Hi, I'm Andrija Jelenkovic, a computer enthusiast turned software engineer. I've been thinking of making my own blog for quite some time now, but I have always found some excuses why I shouldn't start. Whether it is actually having more important things to do or just procrastination, but I guess that is no more.

## What you can expect

The initial idea for this blog is to get some of my thoughts into the world. I will try to stick to computer science topics, but I may throw in some more general thoughts and articles to keep it fresh. You can expect some guides, tutorials, experiences, opinions and hot-takes. It's totally possible that some of my posts age like milk, as I am human afterall and my opinions will change over time, but I'll keep the posts as I believe it is important to see how things have evolved over time.

There isn't any possibility of leaving comments, as I currently don't have any plan or time to moderate them. You can think of this blog as more of a professional journal, that just so turn out to be public.

I'll also use this blog as a means to practice my writting, it is entirely possible that the first couple of posts suck, but I guess we all have to start somewhere. You can just hope I "git gud" fast, for your sake.
