                    Officially, my job involves a lot of programming, designing, writing,
                    code reviews etc.<br>
                    But really? I solve problems, simple as that.

        <p>I had learned to code when I was 11 years old, in Turbo Pascal (yes, the blue
            screen IDE without syntax highlighting, good times). Right now, you are probably thinking that I
            was
            a child prodigy, destined to be a 1337x programmer, but I didn’t really see myself that way.
            Back
            then, I hated going to school, just as most of the kids did. I looked for every opportunity not
            to
            attend classes. In my elementary school, if you went to competitions, you could miss classes in
            order to “prepare” for the competitions. Naturally, I went to as many such competitions as I
            could.
            Therefore, I would occasionally miss classes to prepare, while, in reality, I would just stay
            home
            and play League of Legends. Programming came in handy, as I seemed to be good at it, so my
            professor
            started preparing me to attend competitions.</p>
